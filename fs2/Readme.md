## FS2 Tutorial

**Fs2 provides an entirely functional approach to stream processing**

The fs2 streaming library is built on top of the Cats and Cats Effect libraries. 
However, we donâ€™t need to specify them as direct dependencies in the sbt file since the 
two libraries are already contained in fs2.

### The FS2 library has two major capabilities:

- The ability to build arbitrarily complex streams, possibly with embedded effects.
- The ability to transform one or more streams using a small but powerful set of operations
