Projects covered on this repo
- [x] doobie: 
  - A pure functional JDBC layer for Scala. 
  - It is not an ORM, nor is it a relational algebra; it just provides a principled way to construct programs (and higher-level libraries) that use JDBC.
- [x] cats: 
  - A library intended to provide abstractions for functional programming in Scala, leveraging its unique features. 
  - Design goals are approachability, modularity, documentation and efficiency.
- [x] fs2:
  - FS2 is a library for purely functional, effectful, and polymorphic stream processing library in the Scala programming language. 
  - Its design goals are compositionality, expressiveness, resource safety, and speed. 
  - The name is a modified acronym for Functional Streams for Scala (FSS, or FS2).
